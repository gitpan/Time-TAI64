Time-TAI64 version 2.00
=======================

This Module makes available to the user functions to convert TAI64 strings
to unix timestamps suitable to make time calculations.

unixtai64     - converts from unix timestamp into TAI64 string
unixtai64n    - converts from unix timestamp into TAI64N string
unixtai64na   - converts from unix timestamp into TAI64NA string

tai64unix     - converts TAI64 string to unix timestamp
tai64nunix    - converts TAI64N string to unix timestamp
tai64naunix   - converts TAI64NA string to unix timestamp

ta64nlocal    - converts a TAI64N string and returns a string formated with
                scalar(localtime(&tai64nunix($arg))). This is just helpfull
                when dealing with multilog files.
tai2unix      - converts any TAI64/TAI64N/TAI64NA string into a unix timestamp
                returning only an integer with the number of seconds since
                Jan 1, 1970.

TAI64 strings require the '@' character preceding the actual string to be
properly recognized.  This allows easy integration with multilog generated
files.

The following TAGS have been defined to import only the necesary functions
into the user namespace:

tai64     - unixtai64, tai64unix
tai64n    - unixtai64n tai64nunix tai64nlocal
tai64na   - unixtai64na tai64naunix
all       - :tai64 :tai64n :tai64na tai2unix

INSTALLATION
