NAME
    Time::TAI64 - support for Temps Atomique International

SYNOPSIS
        use Time::TAI64;
   
        printf "%4d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d.%09d\n",
            tai64nlocal('400000003c7c743a2121589c');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides support for the hiresolution and somewhat long
    lasting TAI time format. It's 64 bit and goes down to nanoseconds.
    At least, the TAI64N format does while TAI64 just goes to seconds.

    This module provides a routine to convert from TAI back to a usable
    form. It will provide more functions as I get time to do things with
    them.

    It's in XS since the operation to perform the conversion is not one
    of Perl's forte's and is really quite slow (well, my somewhat
    straight conversion from C to Perl performed quite badly). Other
    versions, including pure Perl, are provided in the benchmarks
    directory in the module distribution.

FUNCTIONS
  my $str = caldate_fmt($year, $month, $day)
    Given a year, month and day it returns an ISO formatted string
    representation of that date.

  my ($year, $month, $day) = caldate_scan($str)
    Given an ISO formatted string, or a string started with an ISO
    formatted date, ithis function returns the year, month and day. If
    used within a scalar context, it returns an arrayref of the elements
    (as a Time::TAI64::Caldate object).

  my ($secs, $nano) = tai64n($time)
    Takes a 24 hex-digit number as input and returns the seconds and
    nanoseconds the time represents. Seconds are standard Unix style.

  my @time = tai64nlocal($time)
    Takes a 24 hex-digit number as input and returns the year, month,
    day, hour, min, sec and nanosecs that the number represents. All
    numbers are normalised (i.e. it will return 1998, not 98; and
    January is 1, not 0).
